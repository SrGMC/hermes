                <p class="mt-10"><b>Thank you for using Hermes!</b></p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    When we say "company", "we", "us", "our", "us", "service" or "services" in this document, we mean
                    Hermes.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    <i class="bi bi-exclamation-circle me-1"></i> <b>Note</b>: The following terms of service apply only
                    to Hermes and not to Hermes self-hosted, which would be hosted on its own servers and therefore the
                    terms of service are not necessary. For the latter, these terms of service are provided as an
                    additional template, although you are free to change them.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Whenever we make a significant change to our
                    policies, we will also announce this to you by email.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    When you use our service, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service.
                    This applies to any of our current and future products and to any features we add to our service
                    over time. There may be times when we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms
                    of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms contain a
                    limitation on our liability. Our Data Processing Agreement (DPA) under the European General Data
                    Protection Regulation (GDPR) forms part of these Terms of Service.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use this service. Failure to comply with any
                    of the terms below may result in termination of your account. This is a broad statement and means
                    that you should place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about
                    who we are, how we work and keeping an open door to your feedback.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-20">Account terms and conditions</h2>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Hermes cannot and
                    will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this security
                    obligation.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account (including by others who have
                    their own logins under your account).
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You may not use our service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">You must provide a valid email address to complete the registration process.</p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You must be a human being. Accounts registered by bots or other automated methods are not permitted.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You may not use bots or automated methods (e.g., web scrapers), to extract data without prior
                    authorization.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-20">Cancellation and termination</h2>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You are solely responsible for properly cancelling your account. An email to cancel your account is
                    not considered a cancellation. Instructions on how to cancel your account can be found
                    <a class="text-white" href="/help/close/">here</a>. We provide a simple no-questions-asked
                    cancellation link.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    If you cancel the service, all data will be deleted within 5 days. We cannot retrieve this
                    information once it has been permanently deleted.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">You can choose to delete your account at any time.</p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future
                    use of the service for any reason at any time. Such termination of service will result in the
                    deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account and site statistics. Hermes
                    reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause
                    because statistically speaking, out of the thousands of sites on our service, there may be at least
                    one doing something nefarious.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retaliation) against any
                    service customer, employee or company official may result in immediate account termination.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-20">Modifications to the Service</h2>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the service
                    at any time without notice.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-20">Content Ownership, Copyright and Trademarks</h2>

                    and modifications to the service, without payment or attribution to you.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You must not modify another website to falsely imply that it is associated with Hermes.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-20">Privacy and data security</h2>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies and encryption.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    All connections to the service are protected by a minimum version of TLS 1.2 and connections outside
                    the HTTPS protocol are not accepted, so all your data in transit is securely encrypted.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    To protect your data in case of possible data breaches, we only collect as little personal data as
                    possible and your password is encrypted using the bcrypt algorithm. Moreover, as Hermes is open
                    source, you or third parties can audit the security of the platform.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    Hermes may collect information about its visitors. You trust us with your data and we take that
                    trust very seriously. You agree that Hermes may process your data as described in our
                    <a class="text-white" href="/privacy/">data policy</a> and for no other purpose.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    Each party agrees to treat the other party's data in accordance with (i) all applicable laws; and
                    (ii) reasonably appropriate privacy and security measures to preserve the confidentiality and
                    security of the other party's data.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You own all right, title and interest in and to the data on your website. We do not obtain any
                    rights from you in your website data. We do not use your behavioural information to sell
                    advertisements. We will never collect or store personally identifiable information to abuse the
                    privacy of our users. By using Hermes, you own and control 100% of the data on your website. We will
                    never sell or share your site data.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-20">General terms and conditions</h2>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    Your use of Hermes is at your own risk. The service is provided on an "as is" and "as available"
                    basis. We take the uptime of our application very seriously. Please visit our status page to see the
                    status of our service.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    Hermes does not provide any warranty for the service, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
                    Unless otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the software
                    "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the
                    implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to
                    the quality and performance of the service is with you. In the event that the service proves
                    defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    We design our services with care, based on our own experience and that of customers who share their
                    time and feedback. However, there is no one service that will satisfy everyone. We do not guarantee
                    that our services will meet your specific needs or expectations.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    In addition, we thoroughly test all of our features before we ship them. As with any software, our
                    services inevitably have some bugs. We monitor the bugs reported to us and work on priority bugs,
                    especially those related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs are fixed and we do not
                    guarantee that the services are completely bug-free.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    Technical support is provided by email. Email responses are provided on a reasonable effort basis
                    with no guaranteed response time.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    We, as humans, may access your data to assist you with support requests you make and to maintain and
                    safeguard Hermes to ensure the security of your data and the service as a whole.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mt-20">Liability</h2>

                <p class="mt-10">We mention liability throughout these Terms, but to put it all in one section:</p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You expressly understand and agree that Hermes shall not be liable, at law or in equity, to you or
                    any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive
                    or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use,
                    data or other intangible losses (even if Hermes has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages), resulting from: (i) the use or inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement
                    of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased
                    or obtained or from messages received or transactions conducted through or from the Services; (iii)
                    unauthorised access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) the statements or conduct
                    of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms of Service or the
                    services, whether for breach of contract, tort (including negligence, whether active or passive), or
                    any other theory of liability.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    In other words: choosing our services means you are betting on us. If the bet doesn't work out, it's
                    your fault, not ours. We do our best to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of
                    the business; investments in security, infrastructure and talent; and, in general, being satisfied.
                    If you decide to use our services, thank you for choosing us.

                <p class="mt-10">
                    This agreement shall be governed by the laws of Spain, and the courts of Spain shall have exclusive
