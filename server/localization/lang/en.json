Once you have created a plan from the [recommendations](/help/recommend/), from the plan interface you can manage this or all the plans you have created.\n\n## 1. Plans\n\nIn Hermes, there are two types of plans:\n\n- **Active plans**: These are plans in which today is between the start and end date of the plan or whose start date is in the future.\n- **Past plans**: These are plans that have occurred in the past.\n\n[![](/assets/help/plans.png)](/assets/help/plans.png)\n\n## 2. Status\n\nIn Hermes, a plan can be in one of the following statuses:\n\n- **Planning**: Hermes is finishing planning your route. This can take up to 5 minutes.\n- **Active**: Your plan is active! This means that you are making it or it is pending to be made.\n- **Completed**: This plan has already been completed.\n- **Route not found**: Hermes could not find a route for your plan. You may have added too many sites or set too little time. Try deleting the plan and recreating it by reducing the number of sites or increasing the length of the day or trip.\n- **Internal error**: An internal error occurred during planning. Please delete the plan and create it again later. If the error persists, please contact us.\n\n## 3. Plan information\n\nWhen you open one of the plans, you will be shown the complete plan.\n\n[![](/assets/help/plan_1.png)](/assets/help/plan_1.png)\n\nIn the plan, you will see the start and end times of each visit, along with the duration of the visit and the travel time between locations.\n\nThere are 5 different types of locations:\n\n- **Start**: This is the starting point you set when you created the plan.\n- **Place**: This is a place in the Hermes database that you selected before creating the plan.\n- **Break**: A rest period, e.g. lunch time.\n- **Waiting**: A waiting period because the next place to visit is not yet open.\n- **Custom**: In a custom place, which you have created manually and which is not in the Hermes database.\n\nIf the plan is longer than one day, you can switch between days using the \"Previous day\" and \"Next day\" buttons. \n\n### 3.1 Editing a plan\n\nYou can edit an **active** plan at any time. To do this, press the \"Edit\" button.\n\nBy activating the edit mode you will be able to, from the top and bottom of the interface:\n\n- Move the start date of the plan forward or backward.\n- Change the name and description of the plan\n- Insert places, breaks, waits or customised places\n- Change element durations\n- Remove items from the plan\n- Add notes\n\n[![](/assets/help/plan_2.png)](/assets/help/plan_2.png)\n\nOnce you save your changes, Hermes will automatically recalculate all the times and refresh the page to display them.",

Create a new rating\n\nIf you want to rate a new site, you have two ways to do this. First, by clicking on a site's stars in _Pending ratings_.\n\nSecondly, by clicking on the \"Add rating\" button. When you click on that button, a search engine will open where you can find the site you want.\n\n[![](/assets/help/ratings_2.png)](/assets/help/ratings_2.png)\n\nOnce you have found the desired site, click on one of the stars to create the rating.\n\n[![](/assets/help/ratings_3.png)](/assets/help/ratings_3.png)\n\nWhen you click on a star, this will be the score you assign to this place.

Explore\n\nThe explore panel consists of two sections: the list of places and the map. In the list of places you can see all the recommendations that Hermes has created for you, and with the map you can put all the places in context and know where they are located.\n\n[![](/assets/help/recommender_1.png)](/assets/help/recommender_1.png)\n\nIn the list of places, each place is represented by a \"card\".

When you enter a search criteria, the 5 most relevant results will appear.\n\n[![](/assets/help/recommender_3.png)](/assets/help/recommender_3.png)\n\nIn the results, you will see the name of the place, its description and its categories, so that you can quickly recognise if it is the place you are looking for.

Select places\n\nOnce you have explored a place, you can add it to a list to create a plan that contains it.\n\nTo add a place, once you have opened its information panel on the map, click on the \"Add to plan\" button. To remove or deselect it from the plan, click on the \"Remove from plan\" button or the button at the top right of the place card in the list of places.\n\nEach time you select a place, it will be marked with a green border in the list of places, and the colour of the \"pin\" on the map will change from blue to green.\n\n### 2.1.

Plan a new plan\n\nOnce you have selected a minimum of 3 places, you can create a new plan by clicking on the \"Plan\" button.\n\n[![](/assets/help/recommender_6.png)](/assets/help/recommender_6.png)\n\nWhen you click on this button, a modal window will open and you will be asked for the following data:\n\n1.

Hours\n    - **Duration of the day**: Start and end time at which you will start and end the day. \n        - **Note:** Once the duration of the day is set, you cannot change it later.\n3. Start location\n    - Select on the map the place where you are staying during the trip or the place where you want to **start every day**.\n4. Days\n    - **Plan duration**: Start and end day on which you will start and end the plan. Based on the data you have provided above, a minimum plan duration will be calculated, so that Hermes can find a plan. If you are not satisfied with the minimum duration, remove places from the plan or increase the duration of the day. \n        - **Note:** Once the plan duration is set, you cannot change it later, although you can move the start date forward or backward.\n\nIf you want to add breaks (e.g. for lunchtime), you can add them later in [edit a plan](/help/planner/).",
