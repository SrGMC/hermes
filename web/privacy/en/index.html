                    This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the collection and use of your

                <p class="mt-10">
                    We try to use, primarily, services that we host ourselves on the premises, although we may use a

                    providers are carefully selected and meet high standards of data protection, privacy and security.

                <p class="mt-10">This is what it means in practice:</p>

                <h3>What we collect</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-person-badge"></i> Name and surname.</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-envelope"></i> Email address.</li>

                    <li>
                        You are required to provide us with your email address if you wish to create a Hermes account.
                        This is so that you can log in and personalise your new account, and so that we can send you
                        updates or other essential information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is necessary for you to provide us with personal preferences and ratings of places visited in
                        order to carry out our service, as this is based on recommendations from analysis of this data
                        you have provided us with. These preferences are not shared with third parties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A first-party persistent cookie is stored to remember that you are logged in. If you log in to
                        your Hermes account, you give us permission to use cookies so that you don't have to log in
                        every time you log back in. This makes it easier for you to use our platform. A cookie is a
                        piece of text stored by your browser. You can adjust the cookie retention settings in your own
                        browser. Already stored cookies can be deleted at any time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All data we collect is fully protected, encrypted and hosted on a server located in Spain. This
                        ensures that all data on the site is covered by the European Union's strict strict European
                        Union data privacy laws. Your data never leaves the EU.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All emails are sent using a third party email provider. Emails are sent using GMail. We have
                        disabled open and link tracking on all emails sent. Please see Google's privacy policy for full
                        details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you write to us to ask a question or ask for help. We retain that correspondence, including
                        the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence that we can refer to should
                        you contact us in the future. We use this data only in connection with responding to enquiries
                        we receive.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-10">
                    You can choose to delete your Hermes account at any time. All your data will be permanently deleted
                    5 days after the deletion request is made in order to avoid security issues, in case a third party
                    has gained unauthorised access to the account.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">

                    happened, how it happened and what measures we will put in place to protect your data in the future.
                    Remember that you can download your data at any time from your
